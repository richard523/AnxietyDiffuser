## Inspiration
We all have loved ones who suffer from panic attacks and extreme anxiety. As bystanders to witnessing friends and family go through this intense experience, we wanted to create something that can instantly calm the mind. 

## What it does
The app provides a peaceful oasis where users can find calm and focus on the present moment. Our app seeks to improve mindfulness, meditation practices, and the increasing recognition of the importance of mental health and self-care. We use StyleGAN technology to generate a constant flow of calming images in an innovative way to provide visual support for these practices and help users find relaxation and peace. By focusing on these soothing visuals and messages, users can relax their minds and ease their worries, whether they are experiencing an anxiety attack or simply seeking a moment of tranquility. 

## How we built it
Idea and concept: We started by coming up with the idea for the app, its purpose, and the problem it solves. Researched to understand our target audience and their needs.

Design and wireframing: We created a rough design and layout of the app, including the user interface, user experience, and functionality. 

Technology and tools: We used StyleGAN-XL, GPT 3.5 Turbo, HTML, javascript, CSS, Python, AWS, Google Colab, GPU's, OpenAI. 

Development: We developed the app by writing code and integrating the chosen tools and technologies into the design. We may have used different programming languages and development environments to build the front-end and back-end of the app.

Integration: We integrated the StyleGAN technology and GPT 3.5 turbo into the app to generate calming images and inspiring quotes.

## Challenges we ran into
There was a constant bombardment of challenges and issues we ran into on the project. We chose a challenging project and used difficult technologies. We ran out of GPU power several times because of the size requirements of the video.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We came together to make a project we are very proud of. We chose a very challenging project on purpose because we wanted to code and use technologies we have never used before or have very little experience with. In the end, we helped each other debug the code that each of us was working on. Because we chose a project that excited all of us, helping each other through the parts of the project that were hard.

## What we learned
Our team members learned about generating animations with StyleGAN technology. We gained experience with Amazon Web Services and a variety of programming languages such as Javascript. We also learned how to quickly create an attractive and simple website. We learned how much we can accomplish as a team in 24 hours.

## What's next for Fixed Point Meditation
Our priority is to increase the range of objects that the GAN can generate in the images. To accomplish this, one potential solution is to replace StyleGAN XL with StyleGAN-T, one of the latest and greatest GANs. The challenge with StyleGAN-T is that we would have to train it ourselves, which would take weeks. Nevertheless, StyleGAN-T is the most promising solution to creating anxiety-reducing animations.
